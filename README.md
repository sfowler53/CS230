Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-The Gaming Room is a client that is seeking software solutions for their gaming facility. The client is a business or organization that provides space for gaming enthusiasts to enjoy different video games. They require software that is an immersive and user freindly gaming experience for the customers. Their requirements include features such as game selection and launching, user profiles and accounts, capability for multiplayer, payment and booking system, system monitoring and maintenance, leaderboards and competitions, feedback from the user, support, privacy of data and security measures, customzing options, and an overall user freindly interface. The software should also be compatible with different devices/platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
-I feel like I developed a clear and structured outline of the softwares features to the best of my ability. I made sure to follow all objectives and used clear and concise developing measures to ensure there were no misunderstanding and everything was written smoothly. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-The design document helped provide a smooth transition between sections, it guided my development in a way that was easy to understand and showed the functionality and requirements needed. It helped me maintain consistency and ensure i met the project goals.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-I would choose to go back and work on the recommendations more. There were areas I was not too sure of and I would do more research and probably redo most of the section to better my software design template. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-To interpret the users needs I gathered information about requirements from the client. Focusing on understanding their goals, their target audience, and their desired functionalities. Regular communication and feedback loops ensure that you accuratley achieved their expectations. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
-Considering the users needs when designing is crucial because it directly impacts the success of the software. It is important to use a user-centric approach which keeps the user in mind and ensure thats the software addresses real world problems and provides solutions that are good for the users. Usability and accessibility tailors the design to users needs. Intuitive interfaces and workflows make the software easier to navigate. Designing around user needs minimizes resistance to change and allows for users to see the value in adapting to new things.
